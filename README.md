## Description

Colour Doors is a short interactive “side quest” where the player chooses two coloured doors in sequence. Each door choice is randomly generated from RGB options (red, green, blue). After the second choice, the game reveals a final “world colour” by mixing the two selected colours using additive RGB (e.g., blue + red = purple/magenta). The project is built using a multi-screen p5.js template with a start screen, instructions screen, gameplay screen, and ending screen.

## Learning Goals

- Understand how to manage multiple game states using a shared currentScreen variable
- Practice separating code across multiple files for readability and maintenance
- Implement clickable and keyboard-accessible UI buttons
- Learn how to route draw(), mousePressed(), and keyPressed() logic based on the active screen
- Build a basic instructions screen with a functional back button

## GenAI

GenAI was used to support implementation planning (structure of a simple decision tree, suggested variables for storing choices, and an outline for additive RGB mixing). The creative concept of colour-labeled doors was my own (inspired by a door puzzle scenario from The Apothecary Diaries), and I adapted it to fit this side quest format. All final integration into the existing multi-file template, state routing, UI layout, and testing/debugging were done by me.
